# Transaction Building

## Overview

Learn to construct complex, efficient BSV transactions for real-world applications. This module covers multi-input transactions, batch payments, fee optimization, and transaction chaining.

## Learning Objectives

- Build multi-input transactions efficiently
- Create batch payment transactions
- Optimize fee calculation
- Implement transaction chaining
- Use BEEF format for complex transactions
- Handle change management properly
